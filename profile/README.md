# We are not born smart, we #GetSmart.

Science is social hybrid intelligence.

We not only learn from what others have learned; we also learn how others learn.  

# Every single day, we can get smarter and get smarter about the process of getting smarter.

Annotations and engagement along the way matters ... the useful insights from our literature are all about our applied notes in the margins.

Our continuously updated annotated bibliometric connection graphs accelerate hybrid intelligence as we overcome impediments to advancing the scientific process.
