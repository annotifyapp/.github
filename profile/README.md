Knowledge development is almost a swarm-thing anymore ... knowledge evolves rapidly in adhoc teams or swarms which develop around a topic, which is like the queen bee giving off a pheromone ... the swarm forms out of love of the idea and knowledge develops either through some sense of [hopefully polite] social competition and asynchronous collaboration which extends across the globe and across platforms [other than just GitHub, ArXiv, PubMed, ConnectedPapers and soical media] ... knowledge might have it's earliest genesis with the conception of a coherent shared/riffed upon idea, but most of the development comes thereafter through an almost combative process of discussion, review, revision and further competitive refinement ... ***knowledge depends upon lots of annotations, discussions of annotations and continual debate/argument of the annoations***.
