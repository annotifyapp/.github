The ONLY annotated CustomerRelationshipMgmt / WorkOrder / ProjMgmt app you will ever need.

***HINT: It's YOU.*** Well, it's you but only if you are committed to "sharpening the saw" or "leveling up your skils" or ***whatever cliche heuristic that you want to use to trigger YOU to never settle*** but instead look better and faster methods, SIMPLER tools. 

YOUR discipline of improving your habits by requires daily exercise and refinement ... it's about finding ways to listen better, to pay closer attention to what works for people and using/simplifying tools/methods ... do not ever let your workflow become calcified because are too attached to an APP. 

Your cognitive flexibility is the APP that you must exercise, continually refine, occasionally refactor in order to be the best, most productive, least expensive APP you will will ever need. You must make it better tomorrow in order to make it still better next week ... if you can improve by three percent every two weeks, you more than double your output in less than a year.
