**Get Smart!**
 
***We learn from how others learn*** ... that includes learning how other humans learn ... which means that it is also about learning from machines and how others use and design learning machines ... from the collaborative development processes of learning machines evolves based upon following and ***annotating*** performance monitoring data of tensor cores but also by setting up ***automated notations*** from entirely different, competing learning technologies ... **annotification** is entirely about ***the humility of awareness*** and *appreciating the beauty of other modeds of thought that arise out of thinking entirely differently.* 

Competitive HYBRID intelligence depends upon different cognitive intelligences of humans using curated, open, forkable, collaborative AI machine learning to continually ***get smarter*** than proprietary, closed-source recommendation engines can ever be.
