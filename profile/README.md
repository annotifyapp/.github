# Annotify.APP is about keeping ecoystems of ideas, concepts, data

*It's not about beekeeping; annotify.app is about managing the complexity of professional knowledge hives.* 

Knowledge development is a multi-hive swarm ... it is never an individual thing anymore; it is seldom even just a team or group thing -- it's not even contained within associations anymore

***Knowledge depends upon lots of cognitive differences.***  To handle this, we read more than ever, analyze more data and make annotations which we share and review ... because we need hybrid intelligence, not just AI/ML. We need creative difference. Different appraisals of lots of connections and contradictions along with an ongoing derivative debate/argument of the annoations, connections, contradictions.
