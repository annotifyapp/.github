Collaborative workflow mgmt for distributed, reproducible, extensible reliability engineering data analyses with annotated discussion and notifications for peer review.

# Annotify.App will be an illustrative example of the Annotify.ORG open source workflow mgmt system.

In general, we see this implementation as being about using patterns and re-using as much code as possible from the Pythonic data science ecosystem, eg [Conda package mgmt](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), the [Jupyter architecture](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html) and the [standard .ipynb JSON notebook schema](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat), [SnakeMake workflow mgmt system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), as well as others, like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Amazon EMR JupyterHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-jupyterhub.html) or others which use a similar, ***nearly*** standard architecture.

We believe that this distributed, but version-controlled workflow should work well for those who are already famililar with [advanced Git[Lab] workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) of including affiliated methods, processes, issues, CI/CD pipelines and a wide variety of tools used in MLops. Data engineering for reliability engineering and warranty tracking in systems [which often involve products from different, possibly competing companies and entities] is perhaps not really so much feature-based as with software as much as the forks in the reliability analyses might be annotation-based or driven by cross-referenced or other documented concerns which arise during peer-review of the analyses of issues and opportunities for improvement.
