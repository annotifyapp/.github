# Ecoystems of Ideas, Concepts, Data

Knowledge development is like a multi-hive swarm ... it is never an individual thing anymore; it is seldom even just a team or group thing -- it's not even contained within associations anymore, since there are different stakeholders.

***Knowledge depends upon crowds that contain an unmanagably complex array of cognitive differences.***  To handle this, we read more than ever, we analyze far more data, we engage in conferences with shared desktops with people around the globe -- all the while we make annotations which we share, review and follow up on ... because we need hybrid intelligence, not just AI/ML.

Knowledge requires complex, creative differences ... there's no way to get there from just one side ... the esteem for which you hold that one side is an impediment to understanding the complex, creative differences. Knowledge requires different appraisals of lots of connections and contradictory information along with an ongoing derivative meta-debate or meta-argument of the annoations, connections, contradictions.

**The Annotify.APP project is about** ***ANNOTIFICATION*** which at its simplest is about making annotations and getting notified ... on different repositories and archives and collections of curated content, data and models ... which gets complex in a hurry. So Annotify.App is about using patterns from the Pythonic ecosystem (eg Conda package mgmt, Jupyter notebooks, [SnakeMake workflow mgmt system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), et al) and [advanced Git[Lab] workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) of tools, methods, processes, issues, CI/CD pipelines that might we use to keep ecoystems of ideas, concepts, data ... not exactly like a beekeeper keeps hives of bees that a beekeeper owns, because the ecosystem of knowledge is always moving, changing, going through revolutions.**
