# We are not born smart, we #GetSmart.

Science is social hybrid intelligence ... as maps were replaced by GPS, science is now being defined by the applied intelligence of scientometry.

We not only learn from what others have learned; we also learn how others learn -- [scientometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics) is about extending our learning technologies that depend upon [citation metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Citation_metrics) beyond data visualizations, connection graphs and information dashboards.  

# Every single day, we can get smarter and get smarter about the process of getting smarter.

Annotations and engagement along the way matters ... the useful insights from our literature are all about our applied notes in the margins.

Our continuously updated annotated bibliometric connection graphs accelerate hybrid intelligence as we overcome impediments to advancing the scientific process.
